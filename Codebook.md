Overview:

This data set as a whole is a summary of data first acquired from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 (more info at: www.smartlab.ws).  Of that original data only the variables pertaining to means and standard deviations were included in this data set.  The final result being the average of each observational variable grouped by Subject and Activity.
